    Notes to Grader
    <p>
      Do you have any suggested material to help with this? I have been to sections and I have not found them very helpful. I am struggling a bit with this class, and I would like to do well. I probably need extra materials, and I am looking into getting a tutor. I'm not sure where else to go to improve myself however.
